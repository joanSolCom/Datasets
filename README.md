This repository contains several datasets that have been used for author identification / profiling research papers.

Every dataset has been crawled and composed by Juan Soler Company.

Every resource is in a tar.gz or zip file which contains raw text files that have annotations in the file names such as the following: 

1_male.txt

2_male_HoundOfTheBaskervilles_ArthurConanDoyle_british_chapter1.txt

The annotations give information about the specific text that is contained in the file: in the second case, we have chapter 1 of a book by sir arthur conan doyle, namely the hound of the baskervilles. The name also indicates that the author is male.
